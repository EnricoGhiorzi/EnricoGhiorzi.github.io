## Research interests

My research focuses on mathematical logic and category theory, their intersections in categorical logic, and their applications to Computer Science. I am interested in various sorts of type theory, including homotopy type theory, categorical models for type theory such as the ones provided by simplicial and cubical sets, constructive mathematics and realizability, especially in the context of the effective topos, enriched category theory, and higher category theory.
